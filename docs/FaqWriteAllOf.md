NOTE: The list of category IDs that you send us must be comprehensive.

Valid keywords (e.g., &#x60;has_drive_through&#x60;, &#x60;has_fitting_room&#x60;, &#x60;kitchen_in_room&#x60;) are determined by the entity&#39;s primary category. A full list of keywords can be retrieved with the Google Fields: List endpoint.  Keyword values provide more details on how the keyword applies to the entity (e.g., if the keyword is &#x60;has_drive_through&#x60;, its values may be &#x60;true&#x60; or &#x60;false&#x60;).  * If the **&#x60;v&#x60;** parameter is before &#x60;20181204&#x60;: **&#x60;googleAttributes&#x60;** is formatted as a map of key-value pairs (e.g., &#x60;[{ \&quot;id\&quot;: \&quot;has_wheelchair_accessible_entrance\&quot;, \&quot;values\&quot;: [ \&quot;true\&quot; ] }]&#x60;) * If the **&#x60;v&#x60;** parameter is on or after &#x60;20181204&#x60;: the contents are formatted as a list of objects (e.g., &#x60;{ \&quot;has_wheelchair_accessible_entrance\&quot;: [ \&quot;true\&quot; ]}&#x60;)  **NOTE:** The latest Google Attributes are available via the Google Fields: List endpoint.
